<h2 id="why_this_guide_exists">Why This Guide Exists</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll be frank: this guide exists because of my frustrations with the User Interface (UI) currently implemented in FarSight Studios' <em>The Pinball Arcade</em> (TPA) for Android. My personal opinion is the UI is limiting, it confuses customers, and offers a poor User Experience (UX) for new users (and even seasoned users familiar with TPA in some cases).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There has been talk of FarSight updating the UI. But they have been saying that for at least a year now, and nothing gets done. The user base swells, but the UX still remains untouched. I&#8217;ve been working around issues caused by the UI for at least that long, and the number of cases I&#8217;ve encountered where customers are just plain confused about features is getting to the point where I have no choice but to take action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m trying to solve some of these issues by writing this user guide. The guide contains information about features in TPA that can&#8217;t be adequately explained in-game because of a combination of UI limitations and the complexity of the feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide is not a tool created to disrespect FarSight and their product. Quite the opposite: it is a factual testimonial from a customer (who happens to be a volunteer beta tester and Technical Writer) who feels it&#8217;s necessary to create a user guide for a game that really shouldn&#8217;t need one. A lot of things in this guide can be figured out by playing around with the UI. But there are some things that really aren&#8217;t intuitive, and some things that if you assume you know how they work, you may be unpleasantly surprised down the track.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope that if you are a new user to TPA Android, this guide helps you get the most out of the app. I hope that if someone at FarSight reads this, they understand the intent and take urgent action to address the workarounds and caveats I&#8217;ve documented in here.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The launch button on tables such as Star Trek: The Next Generation (ST: TNG) and Attack From Mars (AFM) is positioned by default directly under the in-game Pause menu. This is impractical for most users playing TPA using the touchscreen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can reposition this button to your liking, in increments of 5%. This setting caters for your individual preference of launch button position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The addition of button positions was not well advertised at the time it was implemented, and still remains something that a user needs to stumble across. Particularly as the item is off-screen in the Portrait menu, and three scrolls down in the Landscape menu. This was demonstrated beautifully in Episode 48 of <em>The Pinball Podcast</em>. The hosts tried to work out why the button was where it was and were totally unaware how to change it based on the in-game pause menu on Android.</p>

<h2 id="Google_Play_Services">Google Play Services</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coinciding with the Season 4 release of Earthshaker, a <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/7293-Implement-Google-Play-Games-Cloud-Save?highlight=google+play+games">long-standing request</a> (one of many) was finally implemented: Google Play Services support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The history behind this request being so important was because the game&#8217;s achievements and high scores were all saved in a local database residing in a protected part of the Android Operating System in <code>/data/data/com.farsight.AndroidPinball.javaproject/files/saved_data</code>. This directory could only be accessed by the user if they had unlocked the devices' bootloader and installed a superuser binary (also known as "rooting").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because some device manufacturers classed rooting a device as a warranty breach, users were not inclined to do this just so they could back up their game achievements and data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While GPS is fantastic, there are a few gotchas in how FarSight has implemented the feature: gotchas that will cause data loss if you are not aware of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="achievements_in_gps">Achievements in GPS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Achievements are grouped together in GPS because of a limitation in the number of achievements a game can support. This means that for each group of five Standard and Wizard goals, there is one achievement for each category.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To qualify for the GPS achievement, all goals must be achieved before the GPS Achievement is awarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that local database? Yep, it is still being used to service the GPS achievements and leaderboard tracking. When the game hooks tell the database that an achievement has been achieved, it adds a flag to the database. When all flags for the Standard achievement group are set, the game triggers GPS to award the associated Achievement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This continuing use of the <code>saved_games</code> local database is the single point of failure for user issues relating to lost data, as you&#8217;ll discover later in this section.</p>

If you do not create a Saved Games restore point manually, <strong>all</strong> local achievements (Standard/Wizard Goals, or Local High Scores) will be lost  if you un-install or re-install TPA on the same&#8212;&#8203;or other&#8212;&#8203;device.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like most users who use games with GPS implemented, Cloud Save is something that happens automatically. The assumption is that if a game has Cloud Save in the app listing, a user is guaranteed that the app is backing up their scores and achievements to the cloud automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And if they want to play the game on another device, or restore to a new device, the achievements earned to date are restored automatically for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> how it works in TPA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until this user guide existed, there was no documentation about how Saved Games worked for the general user of TPA. For those folks not pouring over Pinball Arcade Fans Forums to learn how to use the app, users had no idea they had to create a manual restore point using Saved Games.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you have earned the GPS "Skilled" or "Wizard" goals online, failing to restore a current Saved Games profile to your device will mean that these goals are not reflected locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have one goal remaining in the "Wizard" GPS achievement for a table (4 out of 5 goals complete),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Un-install TPA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have no Saved Game restore point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installed TPA again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this scenario, you would have to start your Wizard Goals again for that table because the local database has no record of the other four goals being achieved. GPS does. TPA does not.</p>

<p>You need to keep manually creating backups using Saved Games in case you need to restore. Depending on how much you play TPA will determine how often you create a backup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general guideline:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Back up after you achieve a Goal or a High Score in TPA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up no less than weekly if you are a regular TPA player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up no less that monthly if you are a casual player.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no way to schedule a Saved Games backup in the game, so you will need to rely on other systems to remind you. I set a Calendar reminder to back up each month, which is a workaround until a better way of managing this important data-retention activity is implemented.</p>

<h3 id="why_does_this_happen">Why Does This Happen?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ryan Routon, the former Android developer for TPA, confirmed back in October 2013 in <a href="http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/6182-Pack-19-Beta?p=108893&amp;viewfull=1#post108893">this post</a> that TPA uses a custom made in-house audio mixer&#8212;&#8203;lets call it FarSight Audio Mixer (FAM)--that is a bit "laggy". It mixes everything into a single channel (yep, no Stereo on any table: even those that originally supported it), which is then sent as a stream to the Java side of the app to be submitted in chunks to the OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This lagginess was present well before October 2013 but the reasons causing the issue were not revealed until this date. Advances in devices since this date has not seen a performance boost in how the FarSight Audio Mixer operates. Frustratingly, there is no workaround to this issue, unless the mixer is completely rewritten. Lets just say a complete rewrite of the FAM is <strong>highly unlikely</strong> to happen. Ever.</p>

<p>Due to the game framework it would be impossible to provide all sounds in a sound pool. All sounds are included in a big byte chunk for each table. Flippers are universal so those are fine to sound pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What have you tried to fix the issue?</em></p>
<p>Decrease the audio block size: every time I make the block size smaller to pass to the Stream it breaks some devices and you hear blips in between. Bugs me to no end but not sure what to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why not make the block size tunable by the user?</em></p>
<p>The block size is device dependent, and is queried automatically by the Android OS for the most optimal block size. Anything smaller than optimal and the audio stream just does not work, which would likely result in force closes because the buffer is trying to read bytes that aren&#8217;t there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>So what is the underlying issue that is causing the headaches?</em></p>
<p>It is actually the streaming aspect that is causing the delay. Even Google admits that the latency issues have been a long-standing issue on Android. They have been improving since ICS, but are still not really quite right.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even with Android 5.0 'Lollipop', and the default move to Android Runtime (ART) the Audio latency issue has not improved in one-an-a-half years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The writer is now quite dubious whether the stated issues are partly OS/app or entirely the FAM now. For example, the Shield Tablet has a huge amount of processing power and it still suffers from the Audio Latency. This just doesn&#8217;t add up to me.</p>
